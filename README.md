# Portfolio Website Template

This repository contains a portfolio website template that I use. The template is simple to use and easy to customize.[Demo](https://playful-faun-6e8918.netlify.app/)

### Prerequisites :

To run the code locally and see live updates as you make changes, you need to have the **Live Server** extension installed in your code editor. This extension helps in testing modifications quickly.

- **Live Server**: [Documentation](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer)

### Steps :

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository.git
   ```
2. Open the project in your code editor.

3. Start the Live Server:
   - Right-click on the `index.html` file and select "Open with Live Server" (if using VSCode).
   - Alternatively, follow the Live Server documentation for other editors.

### Customization :

You need to customize the website by editing the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files in this repository. Use the Live Server to preview your changes instantly.

## Hosting and Deployment :

To host and deploy the website, I recommend using **Netlify**. Here's a quick guide to deploying your site:

1. Create a Netlify account: [Netlify Sign Up](https://www.netlify.com/)

2. Once logged in, click on **"Add a new site"**.

3. Choose the **GitHub** option and connect your repository.

4. Netlify will automatically detect your site settings, but you can adjust the build settings if necessary.

5. Click **"Deploy site"**, and you're done!

Your portfolio website is now live and accessible online.
